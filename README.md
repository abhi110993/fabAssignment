About:
This framework deals with the automation of Andriod application. I have used "FabHotels" andriod application and automated some of the test cases using selenium and appium tools.

Installations:
1. Latest Jdk and JRE
2. Maven

System Configuration:
Add java and maven path to bin directory under path system environment variable

Note:
1. The locators used here to automate the andriod application may change if used with the latest Fabhotels application version.
2. The code is just to demonstrate how to automate andriod application. It may be possible that the application may not work properly as the webservices may change with time.
